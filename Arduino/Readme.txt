To be able to upload the car code to the Arduino you must first downlaod the Arduino IDE.

Once you have done that to be able to compile the code be sure to include the libraries under the libraries folder to your libraries folder in your Arduino installation. This folder is usually under $HOME/Arduino/Libraries
So just copy paste the libraries to the appropriate folder and restart your Arduino IDE.
