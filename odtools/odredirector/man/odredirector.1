.SH NAME
odredirector \- This tool dumps containers from an OpenDaVINCI container conference session to stdout or pumps back containers read from stdin to a running container conference session.



.SH SYNOPSIS
.B odredirector --cid=<CID> --tostdout=1 [OPTIONS]

.B odredirector --cid=<CID> --tostdout=1 --jpegquality=8 [OPTIONS]

.B odredirector --cid=<CID> --fromstdin=1 [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
odredirector belongs to OpenDaVINCI and is a tool that dumps containers, which are
exchanged between distributed software components, to stdout or pumps back containers
read from stdin to a running container conference session.

This tool can only be used within an existing OpenDaVINCI container conference session
created by odsupercomponent(1).


.SH OPTIONS
.B --cid=<CID>
.RS
This parameter specifies the conference identifier (CID) that is used to join a
running container conference session. The session itself needs to be created by
odsupercomponent(1).
.RE


.B --freq=<FREQ>
.RS
This parameter specifies the runtime frequency in Hz that is used to run odredirector.
If this parameter is omitted, a runtime frequency of 1 Hz is used.
.RE


.B --fromstdin=1
.RS
This parameter specifies that odredirector will read a data stream of containers
from stdin to be pumped back to the running container conference session.

Please note that the dumped data is streamed back as fast as possible without
letting time pass between two consecutively stored containers. If the data shall
be streamed back preserving the time gap between two containers, odplayer(1) is
recommended to be used.
.RE


.B --jpegquality=<1..100>
.RS
odredirector will compress data of type SharedImage using JPEG. This parameter
specifies the quality in the range [1,100] and can be used alongside with '--tostdout=1'.

Please note that the quality is limited by the maximum size of the payload for
a UDP packet; if a quality factor is selected, which would result in compressed
images violating this limit, an error message is printed to stderr and the current
instance of SharedImage is not processed.

If this parameter is omitted, the default quality level of 15 is used.
.RE


.B --realtime=<0..49>
.RS
This parameter will schedule odredirector to use the SCHED_FIFO soft realtime
scheduler. The parameter specifies the scheduling priority.

Please note that this feature is only available on Linux-based systems having a
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT kernel. In addition, odredirector needs to be executed with
superuser privileges.

This parameter has no effect if odsupercomponent(1) is started using the
parameter '--managed'.
.RE


.B --tostdout=1
.RS
This parameter specifies that odredirector will dump any containers received from
the container conference session to stdout.
.RE


.B --verbose=<0..10>
.RS
This parameter specifies the verbosity level that is used to print some information to stdlog.
.RE



.SH EXAMPLES
The following command simply dumps all containers to stdout where they are stored in a dump file.

.B odredirector --cid=111 --tostdout=1 > dumpFile

The following command reads data from stdin to be pumped back to the running container conference
session. Please note that the data is pumped back without evaluating the sending latency between
two consecutive containers.

.B cat dumpFile | odredirector --cid=111 --fromstdin=1

The following command illustrates how to bridge data from one container conference session to
another. On the receiving node having the container conference session running at CID 222, the
tool nc(1) is used to listen on port 1234 for incoming TCP connections. The sending node is
also using nc(1) to forward dumped data from the container conference session running at CID
111 through TCP to the server on host 192.168.0.10 listening on port 1234.

.B nc -k -l 1234 | odredirector --cid=222 --fromstdin=1

.B odredirector --cid=111 --tostdout=1 | nc 192.168.0.10 1234
